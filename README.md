1 - To start we had to register on Vercel (https://vercel.com/), then we
been able to connect and link our Github.

2 - Secondly Via Vercel I was able to import my Github project and deploy on the net.
Following this I activated Checkly via the "Running Checks" tab, then I made a commit/pussh to update.

3 - Following this I installed imgbot which is in the gitub marketplace which
will optimize the images. Then we had to choose another "app" in the marketplace
which would allow us to optimize our code. So I chose Code factor which gives us tips to optimize our code.

4 - Then I'm currently writing the ReadMe so not much to say about it xD

5 - Finally I registered on Zapier (https://zapier.com/) in order to link my github repo
a discord and be able to send automatic webhook messages to certain events (ex: new repo on the project or new commit , etc...)
